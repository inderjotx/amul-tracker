# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for the Amul Tracker application.

## Available Scripts

### Database Scripts

#### `seed-mongo.ts`

Seeds the MongoDB database with product data from the JSON file.

```bash
pnpm run db:seed
```

#### `download-images.ts`

Downloads product images from the Amul API and updates the database with local image paths.

```bash
pnpm run db:download-images
```

**What this script does:**

1. Reads product data from `data.json`
2. For each product, downloads the first image from the `fileBaseUrl + images[0].image` URL
3. Saves images to `public/product-images/` directory
4. Names each image file using a slug created from the product name
5. Updates the product record in MongoDB with the new local image path (`/product-images/slug.ext`)

**Features:**

- Creates product slugs from product names (removes special characters, converts to lowercase, replaces spaces with hyphens)
- Handles different image file extensions (jpg, png, etc.)
- Provides detailed logging of download progress
- Error handling for failed downloads
- Summary statistics at the end

**Example output:**
